# Starbucks-Capstone-Project
This project is part of Udacity DataScience Nanodegree Capstone

# Installation
Python version 3

# Project Motivation
In this project, I will be analyzing starbucks offer and transcation data to see different types of offers, and see what a successful offer emans fore cah type, and what features in the dataset have most impact on predicting offer's success.

# File Description
There are three json files in this project that contain the raw data:
a) Portfolio - includes information on different starbucks offers
b) Profile - Customer demographics- any population that received/viewed/completed the offer
c) Transcript - Customer transaction data

# Project Description
In this project, I will look at all the data Starbucks has provided, and clean and process the data as necessary for analysis. I will define what a successful offer is, and then do an exploratory analysis. I will then use machine learning algorithms to come up with a best model to predict an offer's succes.
